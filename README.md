# Swim For Love 2019

All the code for the 2019 Swim For Love Charity Event.

The code for last year's event can be found at [yu-george/swim4love](https://github.com/yu-george/swim4love).

The `local` directory is not a part of the Flask web application, but contains scripts to run locally on a computer.
