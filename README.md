# Swim For Love 2019

All the code for the 2019 Swim For Love Charity Event.

The code for last year's event can be found at [yu-george/swim4love](https://github.com/yu-george/swim4love).

The `local` directory is not a part of the Flask web application, but contains scripts to run locally on a computer.

Run
```sh
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```
to create the environment, and
```sh
conda activate swim4love
```
to activate.
